Improvements to consider: 

1. The buttons perform grow animation during start/win state attract animation.

2. When playing buttons, the animation finishes after the the state changes. A fixed version of that bug is in main2.ts. However, main2.ts can only activate/inactivate CHEATING mode before/after HUMAN state.
